# iMASK
ECE 110 honors lab project by Sungmin Cho and Edan Elazar

With the current pandemic, masks are a necessity in everyday life. If one wants to watch a movie, eat at a restaurant, or study at a library, one needs a mask. However, masks can be easily forgotten or lost when they are needed the most. Our solution to this problem is iMASK, an autonomous vehicle that carries free masks around the campus for those who unfortunately lost or do not have their masks. iMASK can follow a designated path, avoid obstacles, and recognize humans and common hand signs for commands.
